Spinnergy / PlateWise Connect
=================================

This repo was generated by a script. It contains:

- client/  -> React frontend (deployable static site)
- server/  -> Express backend (nutrition proxy + simulate)

Flow:
- Frontend authenticates users with Firebase (configured for your project).
- Meal lookup is proxied through the Express server which calls Nutritionix (server-side env keys).
- Energy points can be sent from a Micro:bit via Web Bluetooth (NUS UART) to the frontend.
- If Bluetooth is not available, judges can use the "Simulate Energy" button.

Quick start (local dev):
1. Install Node.js (v16+)
2. cd spinnergy/server
   npm install
   npm start   # server runs on port 4000 by default
3. cd ../client
   npm install
   npm start   # client runs on port 3000

Deploying:
- Create a GitHub repo and push this folder.
- On Render: create two services:
  1) Web Service for server (Start command: `npm start` in /server). Set env vars:
     - NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID
     - NUTRITIONIX_APP_KEY
     - FIREBASE_API_KEY (optional, not required server-side)
  2) Static Site for client (build command: `npm run build`, publish: /client/build)

Firebase config is embedded in client/src/firebase.js; update if needed.

Security:
- Put Nutritionix keys into Render environment variables (or server .env locally).
- Configure Firestore security rules before wide release.

Good luck, Srivats!
